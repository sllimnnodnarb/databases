1.Create a database for the model we built in the example. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Write queries that demonstrate the following scenarios:
  Find a guest who exists in the database and has not booked a room.
    SELECT * FROM guests WHERE room_number IS NULL;

  Find bookings for a guest who has booked two rooms for the same dates.
    SELECT guests.name, bookings.check_in_date FROM guests JOIN bookings ON guests.id = bookings.id;

  Find bookings for a guest who has booked one room several times on different dates.
    SELECT bookings.* FROM bookings JOIN rooms ON bookings.id = rooms.id AND bookings.check_in_date = rooms.check_in_date AND bookings.guest_name = rooms.guest_name;

  Count the number of unique guests who have booked the same room.
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT bookings.guest_name) AS booked_same_room FROM bookings JOIN rooms ON bookings.id = rooms.id AND bookings.room_number = rooms.room_number;

2.Design a data model for students and the classes they have taken. The model should include the students' grades for a given class.
  Work through the questions from the example above.

  Document any assumptions you make about what data should be stored, what data types should be used, etc., and include them in a text file.
  Necessary columns including to create practical PK and FK to associate a student with a class in the form of a student_record(transcript), see link to image below.

  Ask questions of your mentor if you are unsure about parts of your model.

  Draw the model using the notation used in the checkpoint and submit a picture. You can also use a tool like StarUML or quickdatabasediagrams.com if you choose.

3.Build a database for the students/classes data model. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Write queries that demonstrate the following scenarios:
  Find all students who have taken a particular class.
    SELECT registrations.student_name FROM registrations JOIN courses ON courses.id = registrations.id AND registrations.course_number = courses.course_number;

  Count the number of each grade (using letter grades A-F) earned in a particular class.
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT course_grade) FROM grades WHERE course_name = 'Bloc';

  Find class names and the total number of students who have taken each class in the list.
    SELECT SUM(attempt) AS total_enrollments, course_name FROM registrations GROUP BY course_name;

  Find the class taken by the largest number of students.
    SELECT SUM(attempt) AS total_enrollments, registrations.course_name FROM registrations GROUP BY registrations.course_name  ORDER BY total_enrollments DESC LIMIT 1;
